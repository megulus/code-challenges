Definitions:
n = number of calls
m = number of texts

Task 0:
O(1)
Constant time. The array accesses are O(1).

Task 1:
O(n + m)
Linear in the number of calls + texts. We need to look at all text and call records
to find the unique numbers.
(see definitions of n/m, above)

Task 2:
O(n)
Linear in the number of calls. We need to look at all calls to find the longest,
but we do not care about the texts in this task.

Task 3:
O(n)
Linear in the number of calls. We care about only calls in this task.

Task 4:
O(n + m)
Linear in the number of calls + texts - the set accesses (to check whether a 
number is already in non_candidates, or needs to be removed from candidates)
are constant time - in Python, sets are implemented as hash tables.
